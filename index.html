<center><h1> ApproxNet: Content-Aware Approximation <br> for Video Classification on Mobile Platforms </h1></center>
  
<h3>This is a demo of ApproxNet. It shows a sample video downloaded from YouTube on which we are running an object detection task using an approximate version of a ResNet. This version is lightweight enough that it can run on a mobile device and can keep up with 30 fps. For comparison, we show the previous state-of-the-art solution, MCDNN [Han et al. Mobisys 2016].</h3> 

<h3>The figure depicts the class predictions of ApproxNet along with latency and accuracy plots comparing the performance of ApproxNet and MCDNN w.r.t to each frame. We can see that ApproxNet is always faster than MCDNN without any switching overhead, while MCDNN incurs significant switching overhead when changing model variants. </h3>
